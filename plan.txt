Thoughts
1. User signup (email & password[hashed password])
2. User Invitations through unique secret IDs i.e email for multiplayer or
   Play against computer.
3. Showing pending games for invited users and invites.
4. Maybe when inviting a user you need to insert date & time?
5. Use csv or real database?
6. In future maybe extend it so that it supports wireless connections i.e WiFi &/ Bluetooth.
7. Use Nodemailer since already know it or smtplib?
8. Maybe extend the project to use Django in future?
9. Show previous games and current leaderboard position
10. Do I really want to use Flet or HTML instead?
11. Maybe add friend request feature?
12. Try avoiding third party libraries and sticking to STD Python Lib.

Game Plan - v1
1. Sign Up / Sign In
2. Use csv as a database
3. Hash passwords using bycrypt/related before storing
4. Show position in the leaderboard | Number of defeats and wins
5. Show previous games
6. Show pending games
7. Start a new game against: ['computer' or 'friend' or 'invite']
8. Show list of friends and sent invites


Flet for the UI and game mechanics (flipping cards, managing turns, timers, and scores).
User Invitations through unique secret IDs for multiplayer.
Turn-based gameplay where each player gets 5 seconds to make a move.
Paging System so users can invite others to play.
Nodemailer to send notifications when a player is invited.

Plan for Development
1. Multiplayer Game Logic
    Players take turns flipping cards.
    5-second countdown per turn.
    Score is updated based on successful matches.

2. Game Invitation System
    Each player has a unique secret ID.
    Players can invite others via a UI prompt.
    Once invited, the recipient gets an email with a game link.

3. Real-time Gameplay
    Use WebSockets for real-time updates when a move is made.
    Show an alert when the other player plays their turn.
